# Data Science Toolbox

This repo contains snippets of code with a little bit of theory and explanation that can be handy for beginning data scientists. It was created while I was attending [Galvanize Data Science](http://www.galvanize.com/courses/data-science/) immersive program in Seattle. Code is in Python, specifically in ipython notebooks as they are easy to view on GitHub. 

Pull requests with updates are welcome!
